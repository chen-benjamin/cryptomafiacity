      Crypto Mafia City will return 65% of gas fees as a bonus to every Crypto
      Mafia City owner on the 15th of each month. 65% of gas fees are going to
      be transferred to every owner after handling fees.
    </p>
    <h2>The details of distribution are as follows:</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      When your collection has at least 1 character in each mafia groups (6
      characters in total), you will get licenses or trading authorizations from
      our random airdrops. As you activate your license, we will return gas fees as
      bonus according to your license percentage on the 15th of each month.
    </p>
    <h2>Bonus Proportions:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>10% - Casino License</li>
      <li>10% - Club License</li>
      <li>10% - Sex Industry License</li>
      <li>10% - Drug Dealing License</li>
      <li>10% - Arm Dealing License</li>
      <li>10% - Guarding License</li>
      <li>5% - Extra Bonus to top 10 players in each project revenues</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For Example:</p>
    <p>
      If Casino License is what you get from our airdrop, you will need to use
      characters in Wah Ching to activate the license (because Wah Ching is
      specialized in running casinos). The game will randomly assign 1 to 3
      activation value to characters. Each license will need 3 activation value
      in order to have it activated which means at least 1 character will be
      used for activation. After activation, you are still the owner of the
      characters, but they are not tradable on the markets. If you wish to
      receive our bonus on the 15th of the following month, you then need to use
      characters to activate licenses before the 15th of the current month.
      After the 15th of the following month, you may deactivate the license to
      make those characters available if you want to trade them.
