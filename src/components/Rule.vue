    <p>
      65% - We will return 65% of Royalties as a bonus to every Crypto Mafia City

      into 6 different project revenues in the game on the 15th of each month.
      As long as you hold Crypto Mafia City, you will be getting these bonuses.
      You can get more info on how we divide these Royalties under [Game Intro].

    <p>
      20% - It will be used on Crypto Mafia Cityâ€™s research, development, social
      media and personnel expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      15% - We are going to use the rest of Royalties on offline events. All the
      owners of Crypto Mafia City are welcome to join for free and please share
      your valuable experiences with us!
